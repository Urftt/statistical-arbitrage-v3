# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-31)

**Core value:** Users can visually explore pair relationships, tune strategy parameters, and see exactly how their choices translate to euros gained or lost — making statistical arbitrage intuitive, not abstract.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — routing-navigation-scaffold

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (routing-navigation-scaffold) — EXECUTING

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Merge deep-dive + research + backtest + optimize into single Pair Analysis page with tabbed interface
- Roadmap: Build order locked — scaffold → statistics → backtest → research → optimize → scanner; Research depends on Backtest for Apply-to-Backtest cross-tab action
- Roadmap: Phase 6 (Scanner) depends on Phase 1 only and is independent of all Pair Analysis tab work
- [Phase 01]: Used pathname.startsWith() for sidebar active state to support query params on Pair Analysis

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4: "Apply to Backtest" cross-tab state design needs a decision before coding (lift form state to page level vs ref-based push). Address at start of Phase 4 planning.
- Phase 5: Walk-forward index-to-timestamp mapping (API returns bar indices, not timestamps). Address at start of Phase 5 planning.
- All phases: Backend APIs exist but have not been tested end-to-end recently. First API call in Phase 2 will surface any issues.
